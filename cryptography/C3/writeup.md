  <li><strong>Description:</strong> This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher! Download the ciphertext here. Download the encoder here. Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}". Browse here, and find the flag!</li>
  <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Use the output as a char and loop through that to find the word "adlibs" which you throw into picoCTF{adlibs}. The provided code snippet is for converting Python 2 code to Python 3, ensuring compatibility.</li>
