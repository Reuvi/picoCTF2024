  <li><strong>Description:</strong> People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate. You can download the challenge files here: challenge.zip Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.</li>
  <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Compare checksum.txt to all files and find the one that matches, then decrypt it using the decrypt.sh.</li>
