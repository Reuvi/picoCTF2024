  <li><strong>Description:</strong> Can you try to get access to this website to get the flag? You can download the source here. The website is running here. Can you log in?</li>
  <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Send a POST in webshell to get the database, which contains your password. Use curl to send a POST request with JSON data indicating that neither email nor password should be null, which will return the password base64 encrypted. Simply decrypt it afterwards.</li>
