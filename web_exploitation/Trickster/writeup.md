  <li><strong>Description:</strong> I found a web app that can help process images: PNG images only! Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.</li>
  <li><strong>Approach:</strong> First check /robots.txt, which tells you of the existence of 2 things: an uploads folder, where your png is sent, and an instructions.txt. Instructions.txt tells you that they are only checking for 3 magic bytes to determine if it is a png, as well as the characters “.png” in the name of the file. A payload can be injected anywhere after the magic bytes for the png are used, and the file can be named decrypt.png.php so that the browser treats it as a php script, which will give you access to the directories, and eventually the flag.</li>
